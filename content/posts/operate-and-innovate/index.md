## Operating

The act of completing a routine task I will call _Operating_.
This is working _IN_ the business.
While _Operating_, you may find parts of the process that could be tweaked, improved, or changed to decrease variability or increase quality.
This puts the worker in a difficult position, they are trying to complete a task but also decide if they have time to change the process.
Is is doesn't make sense to try and change a process while you are executing it.

> Your car is _Operating_ every time you drive to work.
> It is completing it assigned task.
> Wouldn't you ask a mechanical to change the oil in your car while you are driving it?
> No.
> You take it the car out of its daily service routine and improve the engine oil.

## Innovating

This is working _ON_ the business.
Set aside time to consider all of your ideas.
Make sure this is a time where you are not actively working on completing the task you are trying to improve.

Continuous improvement doesn't mean improving while you work, it means having a rhythm of work/improve, operate/innovate.
You won't get stuck when you see something that could be changed.
Simply make a note of the idea and and discuss the next time you are in Innovate mode.

## Don't Attempt To Do Both (At The Same Time)

Operating should be focused on completing the work.
This is, after all, why you are employed.
Ideas about improvement or questions about the process should be recorded and saved for later.

What they need is a dedicated time when they are not _Operating_ and have time to _Innovate_ on the process.
too many tasks to complete to stop and change the process every time there you see an opportunity to improve.

In his book Leadership is Language, L. David Marquet describes these two different modes as Red work and Blue work.

+ Red work = Doing, executing THE work of the business. production of identical parts; goal is to complete.

+ Blue work = Collaborative reflection that embraces change; goal is to improve.
