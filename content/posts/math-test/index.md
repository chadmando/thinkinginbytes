This is an inline \\(a^2=x-b^3\\) equation.

These are block equations:

\[a^*=x-b^*\]

\[ a^*=x-b^* \]

\[
a^*=x-b^*
\]

These are block equations using alternate delimiters:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$ a^2=x-b^4 $$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
$$

$$e^{-i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

# Convert Basis Points To Percent

Basis points, often abbreviated _bps_ is a unit equal to 1/100 of 1%.

$100bps = 1\\%$


# Converstion Examples

Convert 250bps to percent

$250bps * (\frac{1\\%}{100bps}) = 2.5\\%$

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
