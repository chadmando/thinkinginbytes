## Starting The Experiment

I have been thinking about starting a blog for several years.
Self-doubt has been the primary barrier.
The voice in my head is great at stopping progress.
Most of the self talk can be summarized in four points:

1. You don't have anything interesting to share
1. You need more time to work on the site's design
1. You need to learn more about the tech (static site generators)
1. Nobody will read it

I'll address these four items individually.

### 1. Nothing Interesting To Share

I've had a diverse set of experiences over the last 20 years.
In some topics I am a beginner.
In others I consider myself _intermediate_.
The older I get, the more I learn.
Some of the topics I plan to write about:

+ Operating a Small Business
+ Mechanical Engineering
+ Automating a business using PowerShell and Python
+ Cybersecurity for Small Businesses
+ Document My Learning

This should provide plenty of content for now.
Time to get started.

### 2. Site Design Is Important

False.
Let me explain.
I want the site to be easy to read and have modern features.
However, I have decided that obsessing over small details can't keep stopping the progress.
Site design is going to be "good enough" for now.

### 3. Endless Loop Of Learning New Technology

In the time since I first had the idea of starting a blog I have been in tutorial hell with Pelican,
 github-pages, and Jeckyl to name a few.
I settled on Hugo.
No more debate, lets keep it moving.

### 4. Nobody Will Read This

This might be true.
I am writing to clean up my thinking and document what I learn.
If other people find it useful that is a bonus.

## Whats Next 

### Two Year Review

I am adding a reminder in my calendar When I look back two years from now I would like to see consistency.
I'd like to feel some pride in the work but also see the room for improvement.
I need to remember that this was an experiment


## What Do I Not Want to Happen

I don't want to forget that this was intended to be an experiment.
If this effort fails, I want to understand why and not let the self-doubt win the day.
